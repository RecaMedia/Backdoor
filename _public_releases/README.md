### Installation

To begin installation, goto the URL that points to the Backdoor directory. For example, http://localhost/bkdr/ or http://bkdr.mydomain.com/. The installation wizard should prepopulate some of the inputs for you. Make sure the folder name of the Backdoor application is correct as this may effect some functionality. The default folder name is `bkdr`, unless you change it.
